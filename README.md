# Crypto Scam and Crypto Phishing Threat Intel Feed
This is a feed of âœ¨ fresh crypto phishing and crypto scam websites/domains/URLs.

It's a mix of various crypto phishing, crypto scams, drainers, crypto romance scams, and pig butching scam websites.

Let's be real, crypto scammers are some of the worst of the worst bottom feeders in the cybercrime world. If you wanna help fuck with scammers and help perhaps prevent future people from being scammed, roll this threat intel feed into places and block lists where it can help. Block these websites and/or report them to help get them taken down.

This list will work if you want to import it into your [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) instance or any other blacklists.

You can also use this list to perform dir scans against them to find interesting/important files. Every now and then it can lead to you finding their infra, setup panels, and even raw data. Check out using the [PhishingSecList](https://github.com/spmedia/PhishingSecLists) that I created specifically for scanning these types of finanacial, phishing, and crypto fraud websites.
