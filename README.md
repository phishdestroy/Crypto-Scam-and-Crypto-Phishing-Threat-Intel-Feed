# ℹ️ Crypto Scam and Crypto Phishing Threat Intel Feed
This is a feed of ✨ fresh crypto phishing and crypto scam websites/domains/URLs.

It's a mix of various crypto phishing, crypto scams, drainers, crypto romance scams, and pig butchering scam website URLs.

Let's be real, crypto scammers are some of the worst of the worst bottom feeders in the cybercrime world. If you wanna help fuck with scammers and help perhaps prevent future people from being scammed, roll this threat intel feed into places and block lists where it can help. Block these websites and/or report them to help get them taken down.

This list will work if you want to import it into your [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) instance or any other blacklists.

You can also use this list to perform dir scans against them to find interesting/important files. Every now and then it can lead to you finding their infra, setup panels, and even raw data. Check out using the [PhishingSecList](https://github.com/spmedia/PhishingSecLists) that I created specifically for scanning these types of finanacial, phishing, and crypto fraud websites. It can reveal a ton of useful intel during your recon and hunting phase.

Block these urls from being able to be inboxed at your org. Block em from being able to be accessed on your networks. Block them from being able to be shared on your platforms messaging system. Block em everywhere!
